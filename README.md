1. Install Claude Cowork
2. Git Clone this repo to directory where you would like to work (not Box) (or just download and unzip)
3. Add data package to the data package folder. Your data package must have a codebook with indicator IDs and metadata (survey questions, descriptions etc). The more metadata to explain to claude what your indicators actually mean the better.
4. Prompt claude to review the data package and update the CLAUDE.md with relevant data structure information. You can also provide claude with information about the project.
5. You're ready to go!
